This is an assignment from The Odin Project to build the Google homepage from scratch in order to practice building pages using html after examining them using Developer Tools. This is far from perfect, but it is my first attempt at laying out a page. At the time of writing this I may go back and polish this up when I get better.

From The Odin Project's [curriculum](http://www.theodinproject.com/courses/web-development-101/lessons/html-css)
